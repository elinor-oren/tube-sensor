# The Paddingtone
This repository is for an environmental noise sensor project for the CASA0016 course. 

## About
The Paddingtone is a handheld noise monitoring device designed for deployment within the London Underground, stylized in the iconic Underground roundel design. This device is powered by an external battery pack and is easy to transport on the tube, allowing for unobtrusive data collection across Underground lines and stations. The Paddingtone provides a real-time safety evaluation of ambient noise levels in order to 1. facilitate the collection of noise exposure patterns on the Underground, and 2. illuminate the unsafe acoustic conditions for commuters. Offering a tangible and visually appealing solution, this project seeks to contribute to the broader discourse on environmental determinants of well-being and foster a healthier public transportation experience.

## :small_orange_diamond: Connecting + Testing the Components
### Circuitry
The decibel sensor and Neopixel LED support 3.3-5V logic, but the LCD Display requires 5V logic. As such, we will be connect to the Arduino Uno to create a 5V circuit. A 5V power supply, such as a portable battery pack, must be connected to the Arduino Uno's USB port to use the device. 

The following connections were used for each component:

* DFRobot Gravity Sound Level meter - connected to Analog pin A0, GND, VCC.
* Waveshare LCD1602 - this LCD1602 requires much fewer connections than most LCDs and uses the I2C communication protocol, which simply means connecting the corresponding pins to the SDA (or A4) pin and SCL (or A5) pin on the Arduino Uno. connected to GND, VCC as well. 
* Neopixel 8 - connected to digital pin 6 for the DIN Arduino signal, GND, VCC. (Be sure that you're not connected to DO or data_out.)

### Testing
In the final code, the LED and LCD display components depend on the sound sensorâ€™s data readings as an input. It is essential to confirm that each component works individually. Start with the sound sensor component before proceeding to the LED and LCD display.

### :sound: 1. Sound Level Meter 
The Sound Level Meter is almost ready to go out of the packaging.
- [ ] Use the circuit diagram above and the following test script to get the sound meter running with your Arduino.

```

The final code uses the same set-up as the sample code.

### ðŸ”¦ 2. LED
The Neopixel is an 8-LED RGB strip and is very bright at high settings. The example sketches Neopixel 8 allow you to test as you go. 
- [ ] install the `<Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>` library.

- [ ] Use this example sketch to test the LED
```
#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>
  #include <avr/power.h>
#define PIN        6
#define NUMPIXELS 8

Adafruit_NeoPixel pixels(NUMPIXELS, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);
#define DELAYVAL 500

void setup() {
#if defined(__AVR_ATtiny85__) && (F_CPU == 16000000)
  clock_prescale_set(clock_div_1);
#endif

  pixels.begin();
}

void loop() {
  pixels.clear();

  for(int i=0; i<NUMPIXELS; i++) {

    pixels.setPixelColor(i, pixels.Color(0, 150, 0));
    pixels.show();
    delay(DELAYVAL);
  }
}
```



The setLED() function sets all LEDS to a predetermined color...

   depending on the decibel level.

### ðŸ“‹ 3. LCD Display
- [ ] install the `DFRobot_RGBLCD1602.h` library.
- [ ] Use a simple "Hello World" sketch to ensure your LCD is connected properly. 
```

```

The LCD displays the noiseLevel variable output by the LED and the dbValue variable output by the Sound Level Meter.

### Final Display
A completely working "Paddingtone" should look like this.

> [!NOTE] 
> The LED brightness has been turned down to avoid glare when using the device in the underground. These images do not reflect that but the code does.

## :small_orange_diamond: Assembling the Encasement
The encasement files are available in this repo. 
The device is designed so that the sound sensor's microphone has protected yet visually disreet access to the ambient environment through a hole in the "o." 

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/elinor-oren/tube-sensor/assets/127933946/95765174-3a6e-4fd1-a442-ebf8e5944d15">

### Prototyping the Encasement
The initial test face was a scaled up version of a [Prusamaker Underground Keychain](https://www.printables.com/en/model/39900-london-underground-sign-keyring). I printed this as a first iteration to mark the proper dimensions and then modeled the Paddingtone face.

### Modifications 
If you would like to change the name of the device, be sure to account for this. The London Underground font used is [P22 Johnson](https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/P22-Johnston-Underground-Regular) and can be easily imported to Fusion 360.
